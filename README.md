# fontsawesome-wordpress-picker
WordPress plugin to use Fonts Awesome icons on posts and pages as a Gutenberg Block

Based on icons provided in [metadata](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/tree/master/metadata) folder from source project

The plugin is already working, but with some bugs *(feel free to contribute and help me*. You will need Fonts Awesome loaded on frontend to work.

##Installation
Just clone this repository to your plugins folder and activate it.

##Use
After activated, the plugin will create a Gutenberg block called 'FontsAwesome Icons Picker'. Just add it to your post/page and select your icons!

##Bugs
I'm facing some problems when the editor page refreshes. It breaks the block (no worry, you can keep it or convert to a HTML block. The icons will be displayed anyway).

**any ideas how to solve it?**
